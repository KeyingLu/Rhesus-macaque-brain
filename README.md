# Rhesus-macaque-brain

This is the readme file.

This repository contains the code for the literature "Transcriptomic and open chromatin atlas of high-resolution anatomical regions in the rhesus macaque brain". All code was written in the R or python programming language. 

The following description is the detail information for each file and folder.

The detail description for each file of the "R" foler is as following:

Rhesus_gene_count.R: This file is the main differential analysis script.

Rhesus_de_novo_res.R: This file is de novo results script including the prediction of lncRNA.

PsychEncode_data.R: This file is the script for human RNA-seq data.

human_Rhesus_PsychEncode.R: This file is the script for combined human and rhesus RNA-seq data.

Rhesus_human_orthlog_trans.R: This file is de novo transcripts results script

Rhesus_peak_count.R: This file is the script for ATAC-seq signal.

Rhesus_trans_count_with_TACO_gtf.R: This file is normalization for assembly transcripts count matrix
